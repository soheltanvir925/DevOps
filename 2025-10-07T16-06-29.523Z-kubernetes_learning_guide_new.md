## 🏗️ What is Kubernetes?

Think of Kubernetes (K8s) as **the ultimate apartment building manager** for your applications.

### 🏠 The Apartment Building Analogy

Imagine you own a massive apartment complex:
- **Tenants** = Your applications (containers)
- **Apartments** = Pods (where applications live)  
- **Buildings** = Nodes (physical/virtual machines)
- **Property Manager** = Kubernetes (orchestrates everything)
- **Maintenance Staff** = Various Kubernetes components

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of machines. Just like a property manager ensures tenants have working utilities, proper security, and handles maintenance requests, Kubernetes ensures your applications are running, healthy, and properly connected.

### 🎯 Key Benefits

| Benefit | Real-World Analogy | Technical Explanation |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Auto-Scaling** | Building adds floors when occupancy is high | Automatically increases/decreases app instances based on demand |
| **Self-Healing** | Maintenance fixes broken utilities automatically | Restarts failed containers, replaces unhealthy instances |
| **Load Distribution** | Residents distributed across different floors | Spreads application load across multiple servers |
| **Service Discovery** | Building directory helps find residents | Apps can find and communicate with each other automatically |

            CM[👔 Controller Manager<br/>City Managers]
            ETCD[📚 etcd<br/>City Records]
        end
        
        subgraph "Residential Districts (Worker Nodes)"
            subgraph "District 1"
                KUBELET1[👮 Kubelet<br/>Local Police]
                PROXY1[🌐 Kube-proxy<br/>Postal Service]
                PODS1[🏠 Pods<br/>Houses]
            end
            
            subgraph "District 2"
                KUBELET2[👮 Kubelet<br/>Local Police]
                PROXY2[🌐 Kube-proxy<br/>Postal Service]
                PODS2[🏠 Pods<br/>Houses]
            end
        end
    end
    
    API --> KUBELET1
    API --> KUBELET2
    SCHED --> KUBELET1
    SCHED --> KUBELET2
    CM --> API
    ETCD --> API
```

### 🏛️ Control Plane Components (City Hall)

The control plane manages worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster, coordinating all processes and maintaining the desired state.

#### 1. **API Server** 🏛️ - The Main Government Office
- **What it does**: Central hub for all communication in the cluster
- **Analogy**: Like City Hall's main reception desk - every request goes through here
- **Technical**: Exposes the Kubernetes API, handles authentication and authorization, validates requests

#### 2. **Scheduler** 📋 - The Housing Department  
- **What it does**: Decides which worker node should run new pods
- **Analogy**: Like a housing department assigning families to the best available apartments
- **Technical**: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and constraints

#### 3. **Controller Manager** 👔 - City Department Managers
- **What it does**: Ensures the desired state matches the actual state
- **Analogy**: Like department heads ensuring city services run smoothly
- **Technical**: Runs controllers that monitor cluster state and make changes to achieve desired state

#### 4. **etcd** 📚 - City Records Database
- **What it does**: Stores all cluster configuration and state data
- **Analogy**: Like the city's permanent records office that keeps track of everything
- **Technical**: Distributed key-value store that maintains cluster configuration, state, and metadata

### 🏘️ Worker Node Components (Residential Districts)

Worker nodes are the machines that run containerized applications, hosting the Pods that make up the application workload.

#### 1. **Kubelet** 👮 - Local District Police
- **What it does**: Manages pods on each node
- **Analogy**: Like local police ensuring neighborhood safety and order
- **Technical**: Agent that communicates with API server, manages pod lifecycle, health checks

#### 2. **Kube-proxy** 🌐 - Postal/Communication Service  
- **What it does**: Handles network routing for services
- **Analogy**: Like postal workers ensuring mail gets delivered correctly between addresses
- **Technical**: Maintains network rules and enables communication between pods and services

#### 3. **Container Runtime** 🏭 - Construction/Utilities Company
- **What it does**: Actually runs containers
- **Analogy**: Like the utility companies that provide water, electricity to buildings
- **Technical**: Software responsible for running containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O)

## 🛠️ Setting Up Your First Kubernetes Cluster

Setting up Kubernetes is like **choosing your apartment complex setup**. You have several options:

### 🏠 Option 1: Single Apartment (Minikube) - Perfect for Learning!

**Best for**: Learning, development, testing on your laptop

```bash
# Install minikube (like getting a studio apartment)
# On macOS
brew install minikube

# On Windows
choco install minikube

# On Linux  
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# Start your cluster (move into your studio apartment!)
minikube start

# Check if everything is working
kubectl get nodes
```

### 🏢 Option 2: Managed Apartment Complex (Cloud Providers)

**Best for**: Production use, less maintenance

| Provider | Service | Analogy |
|----------|---------|---------|
| AWS | EKS | Luxury managed apartments with concierge |
| Google Cloud | GKE | High-tech smart apartments |
| Azure | AKS | Corporate housing with IT support |

### 🏗️ Option 3: Build Your Own Complex (kubeadm)

**Best for**: Learning how everything works, custom requirements

Using kubeadm, you can create a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices. Here's a simplified setup:

#### Prerequisites (Your Construction Permits)

You need one or more machines running a Linux OS, 2 GiB or more of RAM per machine, at least 2 CPUs on the control-plane node, and full network connectivity.

```bash
# Update system (prepare the land)
sudo apt-get update

# Install container runtime (install utilities)
sudo apt-get install -y containerd

# Add Kubernetes repository (get construction blueprints)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

# Install Kubernetes tools (hire the construction crew)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

# Initialize the cluster (lay the foundation)
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16

# Set up kubectl (get your keys to the building)
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

# Install network plugin (connect the electricity and internet)
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

## 🏢 Understanding Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes objects are like **different types of housing and services in our city**. Each serves a specific purpose and has specific characteristics.

### 📋 Object Hierarchy and Relationships

```mermaid
graph TD
    CLUSTER[🏙️ Cluster<br/>Entire City]
    NAMESPACE[🏘️ Namespace<br/>City District]  
    DEPLOYMENT[🏗️ Deployment<br/>Housing Project]
    REPLICASET[👥 ReplicaSet<br/>Identical Buildings]
    POD[🏠 Pod<br/>Individual House]
    CONTAINER[📦 Container<br/>Room/Apartment]
    SERVICE[🌐 Service<br/>Mail/Phone Service]
    
    CLUSTER --> NAMESPACE
    NAMESPACE --> DEPLOYMENT
    NAMESPACE --> SERVICE
    DEPLOYMENT --> REPLICASET
    REPLICASET --> POD
    POD --> CONTAINER
    SERVICE -.->|Routes to| POD
```

### 🏷️ Labels and Selectors - The Address System

Think of labels like **postal codes and addresses** that help services find the right pods:

```yaml
# Like giving your house an address
metadata:
  labels:
    app: web-server      # Street name
    tier: frontend       # District  
    version: v1.0        # House number
```

---

## 📦 Deep Dive: Pods

A Pod is like a **shared apartment where roommates live together**.

### 🏠 What is a Pod?

A Pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes, like a wrapper around your application container(s). Think of it as a studio apartment where:

- **Roommates** = Containers (usually just one)
- **Shared utilities** = Network, storage volumes
- **Same address** = Same IP address
- **Shared resources** = CPU, memory allocation

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Pod = Shared Apartment"
        subgraph "Shared Resources"
            IP[📍 IP Address<br/>Building Address]
            VOL[💾 Volumes<br/>Shared Storage]
            NET[🌐 Network<br/>Internet Connection]
        end
        
        subgraph "Containers = Roommates"
            MAIN[📱 Main App<br/>Primary Resident]
            SIDE[🔧 Helper App<br/>Maintenance Worker]
        end
        
        IP -.->|shared| MAIN
        IP -.->|shared| SIDE
        VOL -.->|shared| MAIN
        VOL -.->|shared| SIDE
        NET -.->|shared| MAIN
        NET -.->|shared| SIDE
    end
```

### 📝 Creating Your First Pod

```yaml
# my-first-pod.yaml - Your apartment lease agreement
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-web-app              # Apartment name
  labels:
    app: nginx                  # Type of resident
    environment: learning       # Which neighborhood
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web-server           # Roommate name  
    image: nginx:latest        # What kind of roommate (nginx web server)
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80        # Which door/window is open
    resources:                 # How much space they get
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"        # Minimum space needed
        cpu: "100m"           # Minimum resources needed
      limits:
        memory: "256Mi"        # Maximum space allowed
        cpu: "200m"           # Maximum resources allowed
```

```bash
# Create the pod (sign the lease!)
kubectl create -f my-first-pod.yaml

# Check if your tenant moved in
kubectl get pods

# Visit your tenant (see the logs)
kubectl logs my-web-app

# Evict the tenant (delete the pod)
kubectl delete pod my-web-app
```

### 🔍 Pod Lifecycle - From Birth to Death

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: kubectl create
    Pending --> Running: Container starts
    Running --> Succeeded: Normal completion  
    Running --> Failed: Container crashes
    Running --> Unknown: Node communication lost
    Succeeded --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
    Unknown --> [*]
    
    note right of Pending: Like apartment being prepared
    note right of Running: Tenant successfully moved in
    note right of Failed: Tenant evicted for issues
    note right of Succeeded: Tenant moved out normally
```

### 🏥 Health Checks - Wellness Visits

Kubernetes can check if your "tenants" are healthy:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web-server
    image: nginx:latest
    
    # Readiness Probe - Is the tenant ready for visitors?
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
    
    # Liveness Probe - Is the tenant still alive and well?
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      periodSeconds: 20
```

## 🌐 Deep Dive: Services

A Service is like the **postal system and telephone network** for your apartment complex.

### 📮 What is a Service?

A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy for accessing them, providing load balancing, auto-discovery, and reverse proxy capabilities.

Think of Services as:
- **Post Office** = Routes messages to the right apartments
- **Phone Directory** = Helps residents find each other  
- **Load Balancer** = Distributes visitors across identical apartments

```mermaid
graph TB
    USER[👤 User<br/>Visitor]
    SERVICE[📮 Service<br/>Reception Desk]
    
    subgraph "Apartment Building"
        POD1[🏠 Pod 1<br/>Room 101]
        POD2[🏠 Pod 2<br/>Room 102] 
        POD3[🏠 Pod 3<br/>Room 103]
    end
    
    USER --> SERVICE
    SERVICE -->|Round Robin| POD1
    SERVICE -->|Distribution| POD2  
    SERVICE -->|Load Balance| POD3
    
    SERVICE -.->|Stable Address| SERVICE
```

### 🎯 Types of Services

#### 1. ClusterIP - Internal Postal System
```yaml
# internal-mail-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP          # Only internal building mail
  selector:
    app: nginx            # Route to pods with this label
  ports:
  - port: 80              # Service port (mailbox number)
    targetPort: 80        # Pod port (apartment door)
```

#### 2. NodePort - External Visitor Access  
```yaml
# visitor-access-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service  
metadata:
  name: web-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort           # Visitors can access from outside
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080        # External door number (30000-32767)
```

#### 3. LoadBalancer - Professional Concierge
```yaml
# concierge-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer       # Professional visitor management
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

### 🔄 Service Discovery Magic

Services automatically create DNS entries:
- **Service Name**: `web-service`
- **DNS Name**: `web-service.default.svc.cluster.local`
- **Short Name**: `web-service` (within same namespace)

```bash
# Inside any pod, you can reach the service by name
curl http://web-service
# Magic! No IP addresses needed!
```

## 👥 Deep Dive: ReplicaSets

A ReplicaSet is like having a **property management company ensure you always have the right number of identical apartments occupied**.

### 🏘️ What is a ReplicaSet?

A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time, ensuring the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

Think of ReplicaSets as:
- **Property Manager** = Ensures desired occupancy  
- **Maintenance Crew** = Replaces failed units
- **Building Inspector** = Monitors pod health
- **Cloning Machine** = Creates identical apartments

```mermaid
graph TB
    RS[👔 ReplicaSet<br/>Property Manager]
    
    subgraph "Desired State: 3 Pods"
        POD1[🏠 Pod 1<br/>✅ Running]
        POD2[🏠 Pod 2<br/>❌ Failed]  
        POD3[🏠 Pod 3<br/>✅ Running]
        POD4[🏠 Pod 4<br/>⚡ Creating...]
    end
    
    RS -->|Monitors| POD1
    RS -->|Detects Failure| POD2
    RS -->|Maintains| POD3
    RS -->|Creates Replacement| POD4
    
    RS -.->|Target: 3 healthy pods| RS
```

### 📋 Creating a ReplicaSet

```yaml
# apartment-complex.yaml  
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: web-replicaset
  labels:
    app: web-complex
spec:
  replicas: 3                    # We want 3 identical apartments
  selector:                      # How to identify our apartments
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
      tier: frontend
  template:                      # Blueprint for new apartments
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-server
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "50m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi" 
            cpu: "100m"
```

### 🎯 ReplicaSet Benefits

| Benefit | Apartment Analogy | Technical Explanation |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **High Availability** | If one apartment floods, others still available | If one pod fails, others continue serving traffic |
| **Load Distribution** | Spread tenants across different floors | Distribute application load across multiple pods |
| **Easy Scaling** | Add more apartments when demand increases | Scale up/down using kubectl scale command |
| **Self-Healing** | Automatically replace damaged apartments | Automatically recreate failed pods |

```bash
# Check your apartment complex status
kubectl get replicaset

# See individual apartments (pods)
kubectl get pods

# Scale up (build more apartments)  
kubectl scale replicaset web-replicaset --replicas=5

# Scale down (reduce apartments)
kubectl scale replicaset web-replicaset --replicas=2

# Watch the magic happen
kubectl get pods -w
```

### ⚠️ Important Note: Don't Use ReplicaSets Directly!

We recommend using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets, unless you require custom update orchestration or don't require updates at all.

Think of ReplicaSets as the **building contractors** - you don't usually hire them directly. Instead, you work with a **general contractor (Deployment)** who manages the contractors for you.

## 🔄 The Relationship Between Objects

Let's see how all these objects work together like a **well-organized city**:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Development Team = City Planners"
        DEV[👨‍💻 Developers<br/>Architects]
    end
    
    subgraph "Deployment = Construction Project"
        DEPLOY[🏗️ Deployment<br/>General Contractor]
        DEPLOY_SPEC[📋 Deployment Spec<br/>Building Plans]
    end
    
    subgraph "ReplicaSet = Building Management" 
        RS[👔 ReplicaSet<br/>Property Manager]
        RS_SPEC[📊 Desired State<br/>Occupancy Requirements]
    end
    
    subgraph "Pods = Individual Apartments"
        POD1[🏠 Pod 1]
        POD2[🏠 Pod 2]
        POD3[🏠 Pod 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Service = Building Services"
        SVC[📮 Service<br/>Mail & Phone System]
        ENDPOINT[📍 Endpoints<br/>Address Directory]
    end
    
    DEV -->|Creates| DEPLOY
    DEPLOY -->|Manages| RS
    DEPLOY_SPEC -.->|Templates| RS_SPEC
    RS -->|Creates & Monitors| POD1
    RS -->|Creates & Monitors| POD2

    SVC -->|Routes Traffic To| POD1
    SVC -->|Routes Traffic To| POD2  
    SVC -->|Routes Traffic To| POD3
    SVC -->|Maintains| ENDPOINT
```

### 🏗️ Deployments: The Master Builder

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets, managing the deployment of new versions and providing rollback capabilities.

```yaml
# master-building-project.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment                 # Master construction project
metadata:
  name: web-deployment
  labels:
    app: web-project
spec:
  replicas: 3                    # How many buildings we want
  strategy:                      # How to handle renovations
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1         # Max buildings under renovation
      maxSurge: 1               # Max extra buildings during transition
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:                      # Building blueprint
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-server
        image: nginx:1.20        # Specific building design version
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### 🔄 Rolling Updates - Building Renovations

```bash
# Start renovation (update to new version)
kubectl set image deployment/web-deployment web-server=nginx:1.21

# Watch the renovation progress
kubectl rollout status deployment/web-deployment

# Oh no! The new version has issues - rollback!
kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-deployment

# Check renovation history
kubectl rollout history deployment/web-deployment
```

---

## 💡 Best Practices and Common Patterns

### 🏆 The Golden Rules

#### 1. **Always Use Deployments** (Not Bare Pods or ReplicaSets)
```yaml
# ✅ Good - Use Deployments
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  # ... rest of spec

# ❌ Bad - Don't create bare pods
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
# This pod won't be managed or replaced if it fails!
```

#### 2. **Resource Management** - Set Rent Limits
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    resources:
      requests:              # Guaranteed resources (like security deposit)
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
      limits:                # Maximum allowed (like apartment size limit)
        memory: "256Mi" 
        cpu: "200m"
```

#### 3. **Health Checks** - Regular Inspections
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    livenessProbe:           # Is the tenant still alive?
      httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
    readinessProbe:          # Is the tenant ready for visitors?
      httpGet:
        path: /ready
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
```

#### 4. **Labels and Organization** - Proper Addressing System
```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-application      # What type of building
    version: v1.2.3         # Building version
    component: frontend      # Which part of the complex
    environment: production  # Which neighborhood
```

## 🎯 Hands-On Examples

### 🚀 Project: Building a Complete Web Application

Let's build a **small e-commerce site** with frontend, backend, and database:

#### Step 1: Create the Database Layer
```yaml
# database.yaml - The Warehouse
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
  labels:
    app: mysql
    tier: database
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
        tier: database
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:8.0
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "rootpassword"
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: "ecommerce"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
  - port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
```

#### Step 2: Create the Backend API
```yaml  
# backend.yaml - The Office Building
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend-deployment
  labels:
    app: backend
    tier: api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
        tier: api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: node:16-alpine
        command: ["node", "server.js"]
        env:
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: "mysql-service"    # Using service name!
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          value: "rootpassword"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "200m"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
  - port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
```

#### Step 3: Create the Frontend
```yaml
# frontend.yaml - The Storefront
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend-deployment
  labels:
    app: frontend
    tier: web
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
        tier: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend
        image: nginx:alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: BACKEND_URL
          value: "http://backend-service:3000"
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "50m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-service
spec:
  type: NodePort              # Allow external access
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
```

#### Step 4: Deploy Everything!
```bash
# Deploy all components
kubectl apply -f database.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend.yaml  
kubectl apply -f frontend.yaml

# Check everything is running
kubectl get all

# Access your application
# If using minikube:
minikube service frontend-service

# If using regular cluster:
# Visit http://<node-ip>:30080
```

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check pod status and events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# See pod logs  
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Get inside a pod (like visiting the apartment)
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Monitor resource usage
kubectl top pods
kubectl top nodes

# Check what's happening in the cluster
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```
